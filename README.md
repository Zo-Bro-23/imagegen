# Random Image Generator

This module creates random images (of a given width and height) using random.org's random number generator, and displays them using PyPlot. Note that random.org has a quota on the number/volume of requests, so sometimes this service might be unavailable (upon which an error will be displayed).

Requirements: `numpy, pyplot`
